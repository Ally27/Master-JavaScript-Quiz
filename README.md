# Master-JavaScript-Quiz

This web application is designed to be an interactive quiz game while asking JavaScript related questions. Through the process of building this game I have learned different useful programming techniques. Although it was quiet a challenge and still has many errors, Im excited to return with more knowledge and correct these issues.
